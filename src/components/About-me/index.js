        Hello, My name is Darrin Robinson. I am a full stack developer...in development. Through this bootcamp, I have gained knowledge in many different front end/back end languages, and databases. Although I have no professional experience as a developer , I will continue to make strides to learn all that I can about development. My extensive experience in retail and banking have shaped me into being the hard-working, eager person that I am today.
